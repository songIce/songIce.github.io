I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, supervised by Professor [Arian Maleki](https://sites.google.com/site/malekiarian/). My research interests include high-dimensional statistics, message passing algorithms, statistical physics and signal processing.

Prior to joining Columbia, I was a Research Assistant at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I earned both my M.S. and B.S. degrees from the Department of Automation at Guangdong University of Technology, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Haochuan Zhang](https://teacher.gdut.edu.cn/zhanghaochuan/zh_CN/index.htm).

I am very fortunate to work with [Prof. Junjie Ma](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~mjj/index.html) and [Prof. Rishabh Dudeja](https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/dudeja-rishabh/).

You can find my CV here: [Songbin's Curriculum Vitae](../files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
