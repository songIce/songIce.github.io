This paper aims to provide a unified framework for constructing approximate message passing (AMP)
algorithms for rotationally-invariant models. Starting with a general iterative algorithm template, we
show how to derive the correct Onsager terms in a principled way via reduction to long-memory orthog-
onal AMP (OAMP) algorithms. We use this method to re-derive an AMP algorithm recently proposed
by Fan and Opper et al. Unlike the works of Opper et al. and Fan, free cumulants of the spectral law
emerge in our derivations of AMP from a recursive centering operation, potentially of independent inter-
est. To showcase the versatility of our approach, we devise two novel variants of AMP and demonstrate
its applications to estimation in spiked models.
